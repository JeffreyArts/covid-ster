        "text": "We live in a society in which the individual freedom is under pressure. There seems to be a singular 'allowed' way of thinking about all kinds of subject which have influence on us all. They why disagree with the main narrative, are being put in some sort of negatively loaded box. All in the name of ‘freedom for everyone’. A freedom in which the freedom of the other, seems to be more valued than the freedom of the individualistic invidual. But how can you give the other true freedom, when you constrain their freedom via the same manner. There is no good or evil, there is only perception of deeds, thoughts and things. Which we determine to be good or bad. Without religious ideologies, these concepts of right or wrong are based upon our economy. That it is a good way to constrain our individual freedom, in order to keep the economy in good health is belief.<br><br>That belief leads to conflict is something that our history have shown us plenty of times. Because of this, it is uppermost important that everyone has the freedom to believe what he or she believes. In  a society there must be space and respect for every other person who looks different to the world as you do. The Covid star is a symbol of exactly this. Respecting people who think differently, and give people the freedom to express their believe in a way that they want. We need to stop treating the comparisons between groups of people as absolute truths, but solely as a guide. Because the group to which the individual has been classified by others, does not have to be the group to which the individual identifies themselves.<br><br>The Covid star is designed for them who would like to speak up about this subject without using any words. The Covid star is being generated based on any text input, this way it underlines our individual differences, while the person who expresses him or herself with this symbol connects themselves to group. A group of people who fight for more individual freedom, and against the systematic ideological suppression of those who think differently",

Talk about this subject with friend, family, and strangers as well. Explain them what the Covid star stands for, without convincing them about your own righteousness. Solely show them what it means to you, and why you value what it stands for, for you. The entire concept of good or bad is subjective to the ideology it is based on. Whenever your ideology differs from that of the other, it is simply impossible to convince the other from you right- or wrongness. Espescially when different truths become contradictional to each other. <br /><br />Personally I would love to hear what you think of the Covid star, and/or what it stands for.
