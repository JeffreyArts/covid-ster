        "text": "We live in a society in which the individual freedom is under pressure. There seems to be a singular 'allowed' way of thinking about all kinds of subjects that have influences on us all. Those who disagree with the main narrative, are being put in some sort of negatively charged box - all in the name of â€˜political correctness. This political correctness leads to a situation in which the freedom of one should now suppress the freedom of the other, but in a manner in which the freedom of the other should be more valued than the freedom of the individual self. But how can one give true freedom to the other, when their own freedom is constrained in the same manner. There is no good or evil, there is only perception of deeds, thoughts, and things. Which we determine to be good or bad. Without religious ideologies, these concepts of right or wrong seem to be based upon our economic health. In this construct, it is good to constrain individual freedom, in order to keep the economy in good health. That a 'good' economy is a growing economy, and that it is good to value the economy as the highest priority in human life. Is a belief by definition.<br><br>That belief leads to conflict is something that our history has shown us plenty of times. Because of this, it is of uppermost importance that everyone has the freedom to believe what he or she believes. In a society, there must be space and respect for every other person who looks different to the world as you do. The Covid star is a symbol of exactly this. Respecting people who think differently, and give people the freedom to express their beliefs in a way that they like. We need to stop treating the comparisons between groups of people as absolute truths, but solely as a guide. Because the group to which the individual has been classified by others does not have to be the group to which the individual identifies themselves.<br><br>The Covid star is designed for those who would like to speak up about the subject of freedom and suppression without using any words. The Covid star is being generated based on any text input, this way it underlines our individual differences, while the person who expresses him or herself with this symbol connects themselves to a group. A group of people who fight for more individual freedom, and against the systematic ideological suppression of those who think differently",

Talk about this subject with friends, family, and strangers. Explain to them what the Covid star stands for, without convincing them about your own righteousness. Solely show them what it means to you, and why you value what it stands for, for you. The entire concept of good or bad is subjective to the ideology it is based on. Whenever your ideology differs from that of the other, it is simply impossible to convince the other from your right- or wrongness. Especially when different truths become contradictional to each other. <br /><br /> I would love to hear what you think of the Covid star, and/or what it stands for, for you.

Thank you for your time, and I wish you a wonderful week."
